### Hi, I'm Dave

I don't claim to be a software developer...not really. I'm reasonably fluent with Python, and can muddle my way around JavaScript (and maybe Typescript) and possibly Java if things get really desperate at `$WORK`. Speaking of `$WORK`, you don't see much Github activity for me because I work in the shadows. I try to bring the open source ethos to our environment, and maintain widely used libraries that will never appear on pypi.

My real expertise these days is in software architecture and modern software development. I guess I'm one of those "DevSecOps/Platform Engineering" Unicorns, working with dev teams to containerize their applications, build out their CI/CD pipelines, and deploy/operate on our internal (Kubernetes-based) platforms. And while they're at it, making sure they're checking all the internal security/compliance boxes.

Current areas of interest for me include:

- Software Supply Chain security (e.g. NIST SSDF)
- Internal Developer Portals (e.g. Backstage)
- Automation (especially around CI/CD)

Before you ask - I'm not really looking for new opportunities. `$WORK` has me plenty busy herding cats.
